# TUI Mutagen Solver

This is a port of my [python implementation](https://github.com/vm910/mutagen_solver). It was originally intended to be a CLI tool, but then I stumbled on [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui), which is a very neat TUI crate, so here we are. I used the [simple template](https://github.com/ratatui-org/templates) to generate a base project and ported my python implementation. Overall, good exercise for Rust.
